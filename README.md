# Hi, I'm Štěpán Bříza 👋

I'm a high school student passionate about **robotics** and **automation**. Currently, I'm studying at SPŠE Ječná, where I've gained strong foundations in **C** and **C++**, while also working with **Python**. I frequently use **Fusion 360** for 3D modeling to bring my ideas to life.

### What drives me?
Creating new things is what fuels my passion. I find great satisfaction in solving challenges, particularly in robotics and automation. I’m highly competitive, and this pushes me to work efficiently and deliver results faster.

### Teamwork and Competitions
I’ve had the opportunity to lead a small team called "Lednice" ("Icebox"), where we participated in competitions organized by top Czech universities, including **ČVUT in Prague** and **VUT in Brno**. These experiences have taught me invaluable lessons in leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving.
